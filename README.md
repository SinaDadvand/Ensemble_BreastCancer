# Ensemble_BreastCancer
Ensemble Method for Classification Models based on Breast Cancer Dataset in R
--------------------------------------------

This is part of Project 2 from Data Mining class of Business Analytics graduate program 
for University of Washington Tacoma for 2020 - 2021

In this repository, you can see the R MarkDown file with codes necessary for implementing an Ensemble Method of Machine Learning Classifiers on famous Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

Different classifiers are trained on a subset of Breast Cancer data, algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Decision Tree, QDA , RDA and Random Forest.
Then, the results for all of these classifiers are gathered together and a majority rule has been applied to get the final result for the Ensemble Method.
The accuracy and other measures of performance for Ensemble model is presented and compared to each individual calssifier. 

Looking at the final results for the experiment, we can see how the Ensemble Method create a solid classifier based on other methods prediction, with Test set accuracy of 0.9607	 and F-Score of 0.96770
